### Batch Learning:

1. Trains the model using the entire dataset at once.
2. Suitable for offline training before deployment.
3. Best for static datasets where training can be done on individual machines.

### Online Learning:

1. Updates the model incrementally with new data.
2. Ideal for continuous learning and real-time applications.
3. Suitable for scenarios with abundant data and where training occurs on servers.

### Challenges:

1. Handling large datasets can lead to processing and storage issues.
2. Iterative updates are needed to maintain model accuracy.
3. Timely updates are crucial for software efficiency, especially in real-time data models.
4. Limited internet access can hinder the effectiveness of real-time updates and impact user experience.


### Instance-Based Learning:

1. Definition: Uses specific training instances to make predictions.
2. Advantages: Simple, quick adaptation to new data.
3. Disadvantages: Slow predictions, potential for overfitting.
### Model-Based Learning:

1. Definition: Builds a model that generalizes from training data.
2. Advantages: Fast predictions, handles large datasets well.
3. Disadvantages: Computationally intensive to train, less adaptive to new data.
